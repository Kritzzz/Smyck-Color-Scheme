# Smyck Color Scheme

This is a color scheme suitable for Terminal.app, iTerm2, Vim, gVim,
MacVim, Textmate, Sublime Text 2 and Xcode.

The colors are carefully chosen and the contrasts are tuned so that it
should not hurt the eyes even after a whole day of working.

## Adding the Smyck-Theme to Xcode 4

Navigate to your Color-Themes directory

	~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes

and add the file named 'Smyck.dvcolortheme'. 

If you haven't made any changes to a theme so far, the directory might not exist yet! In that case, just create a folder named 'FontAndColorThemes' in Xcode/UserData and add the 'Smyck.dvcolortheme' file.
 
If opened, restart Xcode. Then go to:

	Preferences | Fonts & Colors

and select 'Smyck' in the sidebar on the left.

Enjoy!

# Disclaimer

Currently its still a moving target but if you want to help, please try
it out and report screenshots of weird looking things.

There is also an Eclipse adoption of this theme available at
[https://github.com/m42i/Smyck-Color-Scheme](https://github.com/m42i/Smyck-Color-Scheme).

Once the final color map is done this repository will include a proper
documentation.
